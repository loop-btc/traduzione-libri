## Introduction

When many people first hear about Bitcoin, they tend to develop opinions before even attempting to understand it. There is so much noise out there, it's easy to be misled about what Bitcoin is, and how it works. Up until three years ago, I was one of these people.

Why did I decide to write this book? I spent the last twenty years building tech startups. I immerse myself in new technology every day, and I'm pretty good at figuring things out. Even still, it took me five years from first hearing about Bitcoin to actually sitting down to try to understand it. I have a feeling I'm not the only one who could use a little help wrapping their head around this potentially world changing innovation.

I first heard of Bitcoin in 2011 from [slashdot.org](http://slashdot.org), a news site for nerds. Back then, the Bitcoin price had gone through the roof to a massive bubble peak of around \$30 per coin. All I knew was that some people on the Internet were trying to start some kind of peer to peer payment system. Not knowing the first thing about what it was, how it worked, or anything at all about investing and market cycles, I decided I should buy some just in case it turned out to be important. I had to use a horrible looking site called Mt. Gox to do so. This dollar-to-bitcoin exchange later turned out to be insolvent.

I slowly watched my investment shrink to nearly nothing, as the price crashed from \$30 to \$2. At some point, I forgot about it completely and went on with my life, working on startups. I don't even know what happened to those coins. I imagine the keys to them are stored on some hard drive from an old laptop, lying in a dump somewhere.

In 2013 I heard about it again. This time, the noise in the media was louder, and now the experience of buying it was a lot slicker. There were apps like Coinbase, which looked downright legitimate. This was a marked improvement from the days of Mt. Gox. It seemed to me tahat Bitcoin could really be something.

Just in case it was, and again not knowing the first thing about it, I bought at the peak of the bubble (around \$1000 per coin) and watched my investment decimated as it fell to about \$200 per coin. This time, I figured it wasn't enough money to bother selling, so I left it be, and, proceeded to ignore it as I was knee deep in starting to build my next startup: [Reverb.com](http://Reverb.com).

Over the next four years, Reverb grew quickly, becoming the number one destination for musicians. I was making a difference in the world and bringing music to people. I was the CTO of an exciting, fast growing tech company, doing something I was passionate about, and I had no time for silly Internet money.

I'm embarrassed to say that it wasn't until the summer of 2016 that I finally watched my first video by [Andreas Antonopoulos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJWCJCWOxBYSi5DhCieLOLQ), which finally forced me to sit up and pay attention. I started asking questions. Where does Bitcoin come from? Who controls it? How does it work? What is mining? What impact will it have on the world? I started reading everything I could get my hands on, listening to hours of podcasts and videos every day for a year and a half straight.

Finally, in early 2018, just after Bitcoin hit another all time high at around \$20,000 per coin, I decided to leave Reverb in pursuit of helping bring Bitcoin to the world in whatever way I could. Why did I leave my very successful startup to work on Bitcoin? I believe that the invention of Bitcoin is the kind of thing that comes around once in a lifetime; perhaps once in many lifetimes.

If Bitcoin succeeds, it may prove to be as important as the printing press (decentralized production of information), the Internet (decentralized content and communication), and three-branch democracy (decentralized government). I hope that by understanding how Bitcoin works, you'll understand how it can turn out to be a force for good in the world. Bitcoin will decentralize the production and consumption of money, which is the key to unlocking new ways for humanity to collaborate on a scale that was previously unimaginable.

The price of Bitcoin is mostly what you hear about in the media. One day it's going to a million dollars, and the next it's in a death spiral going to zero. It's either that or Bitcoin will use all the world's energy and destroy the planet within ten years. Of course this is false, and hopefully you'll understand why once you learn about how it works. You'll also understand why price bubbles are one of the least interesting things about Bitcoin.

My goal with this book isn't to analyze the economics of Bitcoin and sound money, though we'll touch on these concepts briefly. I'm not going to look at Bitcoin from the standpoint of investing, or try to convince you that everyone should own a little. I would highly recommend *The Bitcoin Standard* by Saifedean Ammous as an immediate follow-up to this book if you haven't read it already. 

We're also not going to dig into any computer code, and no computer science background is required to understand this book. If you want to look at Bitcoin through that lens, I recommend the seminal *Mastering Bitcoin* by Andreas Antonopoulos, and the newly released *Programming Bitcoin* by Jimmy Song. 

For me, understanding all the things that come together to make Bitcoin work was a profound moment. In this book, I hope to share that knowledge with you in a short, simple format. My goal today is to tickle your brain, and to give you a taste of the computer science, economics, and game theory that make Bitcoin one of the most interesting and profound inventions of our time. By understanding the workings of Bitcoin, I hope you will find, like I did, that Bitcoin is much deeper than it appears to be at first, and may have an incredible impact on the world for generations to come.

The way we'll do it is one step at a time. With nothing but a high school level math background, we will walk through *inventing bitcoin*, step by step. I hope that this book will give you just enough of an introduction to send you down the Bitcoin rabbit hole. Let's get started!
